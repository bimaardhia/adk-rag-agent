# Step 1: Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
# Using 'slim' is a good practice for smaller image sizes
FROM python:3.11-slim

# Step 2: Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the requirements file into the container
# This is done first to leverage Docker's layer caching.
# Dependencies won't be re-installed unless requirements.txt changes.
COPY requirements.txt .

# Step 4: Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Step 5: Copy the rest of your application's code into the container
COPY . .

# Step 6: Expose the port the app runs on
# The ADK web server defaults to port 8080
EXPOSE 8080

# Step 7: Define the command to run your application
# Use --host=0.0.0.0 to make the server accessible from outside the container
CMD ["adk", "web", "--host=0.0.0.0"]
